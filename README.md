# Data-Driven-Analysis-of-Health-Insurance-Premiums

## Project Overview
This project investigates the dynamics of risk underwriting in health insurance using a dataset of 1,338 individuals. The goal is to predict health insurance charges based on various factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region.

## Features
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the dataset and its features.
- **Modeling:** Apply regression models to predict insurance charges.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction.
- **Visualization:** Visualize the results and model performance.
